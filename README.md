# Crossword Designer

This is the basic skeleton of a React-based web application I started writing
to help me compile UK-style cryptic crosswords.

Be warned that it's far from complete and lacking in many areas.

The project has been put on hold indefinitely since the launch of the
*fantastic* [MyCrossword](https://www.mycrossword.co.uk/) web site which
does everything I originally planned to do and so much more.

## Front End

Run `yarn install` and then `yarn start` to run the front-end React app via a development service.  The code (in the `src` directory) is very unpolished.  Sorry if it makes your eyes bleed.

## Back End

There's the basic framework of a back-end written in Perl that I intended to use to serve candidate words from a database.  I didn't get very far with that.  It's probably best if you just ignore it.
